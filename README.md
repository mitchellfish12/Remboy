## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Want to recreate the popular internet guessing game 'Poeltl', based on the game worldle, where you have to guess a randomly chosen NBA player.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I plan on working alone for this project.
## Do you have any questions of your own?
Nope.

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Poeltl
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A guessing game that displays hints based on your guesses.
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I will program it in python.  It will show displays of different attributes of a nba player, and based on how close each attribute is to the randomly chosen nba player determines the color of the display.  It will function exactly like the real internet game that this is based on.  I will probably use tables to create such displays, while using the colorama module to color them in.
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will finish this project.  You will be able to play it with all of its features by the due date.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I think I will complete full design and implementation of the proposed project.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to focus on correcting the random function of randomly choosing from the playre bank as that has been faulty last time I tested it.  I have the colorama module down, I just need to make sure it implements correctly when the user inputs guesses.  Mainly those two, and implementing the function that displays hints to the user based on their guesses.  Once I do all of that I will be finished with my final project.
